# Sakura
**What is Sakura?**
Sakura is an RPG that is a work in progress. It centers around Mae, a student who lives in the recently reinhabited town of Sakura. The town was fabled to be haunted by a witch whom was jealous of the queen. The witch cursed the land's resources, so that people farming them would die an unexplained death, and she cursed the many cherry blossom trees there so that anyone whom is around one will begin to be driven insane by evil faeries. 

This legend wasn't believed by archaeologist Frank Williams. He went to the town to farm precious gems from its plentiful mining zones. After he returned unharmed 2 days later, many people followed in his footsteps and soon the town was repopulated. Frank died 5 days after the mining incident of suicide. Yet mystery arose from this, as Frank was a genuinely happy man who would never kill himself! Many more miners died within a week of mining the gems. Is Sakura really haunted, or is it just a coincidence?

**How can I contribute to Sakura?**
I don't need much contribution right now, but if you somehow want to help out, I do need some sprites made. I'm not a good digital artist. At all. I'll have custom sprites in the final game for sure, but if anyone wants to make some, I'd gladly take the offer.
